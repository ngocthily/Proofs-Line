# Proofs Line ![alt text](https://github.com/ngocthily/Proofs-Line/blob/master/app/assets/images/icon.png)
Proofs Line is a mathematical question and answer forum with an upvote / downvote and search feature inspired by Stack Overflow and Math Exchange.

Meaning of site name: Mathematical **proofs** are arguments for mathematical statements such as theorems and the mathematical defintion for a **line** is a straight one-dimensional figure having no thickness and extending *infinitely* in both directions, therefore a site of inifinite "arugments".
